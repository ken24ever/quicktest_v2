## Usage

 including account creation, exam creation, exam summaries, and user management.

### Account Creation
The administrator is responsible for creating user accounts within the CBT app. This can be done in two ways: bulk user uploads or single account creation.
 In bulk user uploads, the administrator can upload a MICROSOFT EXCEL file containing user details such as username, email, and password ETC. 
For single account creation, the administrator can manually enter the user's details, including their username and password ETC.

### Exam Creation

such as the exam name, duration, and the set of questions to be included. 
The administrator can utilize the provided Questions template to organize and structure the exam questions effectively.

### Exam Management
The administrator holds the responsibility for managing exams within the CBT app. They can perform various actions on both users and exams,
 such as resetting an exam, searching for specific users or exams with their respective questions, deleting user accounts or exam records, and editing user or exam details as needed.
 These management capabilities enable the administrator to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the exams conducted through the app.

### Exam Summaries
The CBT app offers exam summaries, allowing the administrator to obtain comprehensive reports on exam performance. 
These summaries provide essential insights, such as the overall exam scores, individual question statistics, and aggregated results of all test-takers.
 By analyzing these summaries, administrators can identify areas of improvement and make informed decisions regarding the evaluation process.

## Resources
